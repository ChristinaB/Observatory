# Tools for observing the terrestrial and aquatic surfaces of Earth

"You belong among the wildflowers, you belong somewhere you feel free." Tom Petty

An observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events (thank you Wikipedia). The intent of this observatory is to play a cumulative role in maximizing the scientific return on individual investments of contributors conducting research in the Sauk. Observatories depend on collections of data and groups of people. 

Observatories have been as simple as containing an astronomical sextant, and as complicated as modern academic supported observatories containing multi-million dollar instruments, tools, with institutions supporting long term research and education programs. While observatories are usually thought of as star-gazing investments in the field of astronomy, observatories have also been constructed in climatology/meteorology, geophysical, oceanography and volcanology communities, in order to investigate and coordinate their research efforts.

This repository is intended for the sharing and distribution of open-source Python based code useful for model and data integration that improves access to large datasets, reduces computational burden, reinvent the wheel less often, and share and communicate more about how to synthesize earth surface observations in useful ways.
